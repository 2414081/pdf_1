                                    Consider the following principles: For each object, human(s) or elements, if mentioned in the prompt, check if it is accurately depicted in terms of its visual characteristics as outlined.

                                    - Each set of coordinates should be in the format [(x_min, y_min), width, height], where:
                                    - `x_min` and `y_min` specify the bottom-left corner of the rectangle,

                                    - `height` is the length of the rectangle along the Y-axis.
                                    - Only mark the borders of the necessary elements, and avoid including any surrounding areas.
                                    - If multiple violations are detected, provide a separate set of coordinates for each one.
                                    Example Output for co-ordinates: [(x_min1, y_min1), width1, height1] [(x_min2, y_min2), width2, height2] ...
